            <h2>Boros Bully</h2>
            <h3>AGGRO</h3>
            <p> 
                Boros Bully has one real path to victory and that is heading into the Red Zone.
                It wants to use its air force, composed of Squadron Hawk and Battle Screech, backed up with power buffs to win over one or two attacks. 
                Recursive spells Strands, Screech, and Faithless Looting as well as recursive creatures in Sacred Cat and Lunarch Veteran, plus lifegain, give the deck some grinding power too!

            <img src="./assets/imgs/burn.png">
            <p>
                Aggro (short for aggressive) decks attempt to reduce their opponents from 20 life to 0 life as quickly as possible, rather than emphasize a long-term game plan. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Aggro decks focus on converting their cards into damage; they prefer to engage in a race for tempo rather than a card advantage-based war of attrition.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="archetype-body">
            <h3>CONTROL</h3>
            <img src="./assets/imgs/control.png">
            <p>
                Control decks represent the polar opposite of aggro decks, geared for the long game.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Control decks focus on shutting down the opponent, and win the game later, at their own convenience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their top priority is to stop the opponent from executing his or her game plan and appeals to players who enjoy playing long, and oftentimes complex, games.

            <h3>COMBO</h3>
            <img src="./assets/imgs/combo.png">
            <p>
                The combo archetype (short for combination) focuses on playing two or more cards, often with precise timing, to give you a greater advantage over the effects of individual cards.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Combo decks aim to win the game using a relatively small number of synergistic cards that instantly or very quickly win the game when combined.

            <h3>MIDRANGE</h3>
            <img src="./assets/imgs/midrange.png">
            <p>
                Midrange decks sit in the sweet spot between aggro, control, and combo - a jack-of-all-trades archetype.
            </p>
            <p>
                A typical midrange deck has an early game plan of mana ramp and/or control, but seeks to play high-value threats to play threats once it reaches the mid-game. These decks will often seek to play a reactive, attrition-based game against aggro decks and a more proactive game against control decks.

            <h3>CONTROL</h3>
            <p> 
                Dimir Delver is a control shell, which plays just 8 main threats in a full playset of both Gurmag Angler and Tolarian Terror (big 5/5 creatures that can use the graveyard to reduce their casting cost from 7 to as low as 1).
                Backed up with Delver of Secrets, who can flip from a 1/1 human into a 3/2 flying insect, the rest of the deck is classic draw, kill and counter spells, as well as some self-mill cantrips in Thought Scour and Mental Note to feed the big threats!

            <h3>COMBO</h3>
            <p> 
                Mogwarts is a 'go-infinite' style combo deck. Following casting the instant First Day of Class, you can start sacrificing Putrid Goblin to Skirk Prospector infinitely, generating one Red mana each time. Now that you have infinite Red mana, you do one of two things. You either activate Flamewave Invoker an infinite number of times, or you repeatedly sacrifice Putrid Goblin to Makeshift Munitions in order to get as much damage as necessary to take out your opponent in one go.

            <h3>AGGRO</h3>
            <p> 
                This aggro deck can operate on a low land count thanks to Quirion Ranger and Burning-Tree Emissary and it can grow creatures with Hunger of the Howlpack and Elephant Guide. But none of this matters if the creature can get chumped blocked ad-infinitum. Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, Vault Skirge, and River Boa are all evasive but can be blocked. Rancor renders chump blocks all but meaningless with Trample!

            <h3>MIDRANGE</h3>
            <p> 
               This 3-colour mid-range affinity style deck runs cheap, high-value artifacts with card-draw type benefits that quickly builds high number of artifacts on the board. This feeds the deck's main threat Myr Enforcer (big 4/4 creature), who thanks to affinity can cost as little as 0 mana to cast, depending on your artifact count! Burn and kill spells enable some early game control and Kor Fisher and Glint Hawk allow the retrieval and replay of value artifacts.

            <h2>Black Devotion</h2>
            <h3>MIDRANGE</h3>
            <p> 
                The game plan of this list is very practical: remove creatures that your opponent plays, while playing creatures that offer advantage with extra draws or opponent hand disruption.
                Gray Merchant of Asphodel is what gives the deck it's Devotion name-sake, as the most explosive play comes from accumulating black devotion via your creatures before casting the merchant mid-late game. Commonly the first cast will stabilize the game and recover damage dealt to you, while subsequent copies will leave you further and further ahead in the game.

            <h3>AGGRO</h3>
            <p> 
                Faeries is a Tempo style Aggro deck, which uses a combination of low-cost creatures that have high synergy with each other, card advantage and counterspells to stabilize the board and thus win the game quickly and effectively.
                The main aim is to use the faeries evasive Flying ability to enable Ninjitsu, sneaking Ninjas onto the board replacing an un-blocked attacker in combat and generating card advantage when they connect. This has the added bonus of returning the Ninjitsu-returned Faerie, allowing re-cast and re-use of their ETB effects.

            <p> 
                Ponza is a Red-Green Mana-Ramp style Midrange deck that uses a playset of the Pauper classic burn spell Lightning Bolt, and land destruction-come-ramp spells; to both control the early-mid game whilst ramping itself into the mid-late game.
                Here it looks to deploy typically big Red and/or Green creatures, with high ETB value, to outclass the opponent on the board and clear up with one or two large creatures.

            <p> 
                In this hyper-aggressive Red deck; Kiln Fiend is Paternered with Monastery Swiftspear and Festival Crasher - creatures you can cast for cheap that can gain additional power by casting instant and sorcery spells. If you're able to combine burn spells, draw spells, and Temur Battle Rage to give it double-strike, you can deal 20 damage really early-on with Kiln Fiend alone!

            <h3>CONTROL</h3>
            <p> 
                This classic Blue-White control deck favours locking out the opponent from their game plan, making it well into the late game before pushing for a win.
                This works by creating a tremendous draw engine using the likes of both Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle alongside Ghostly Flicker and Ephemerate to go through your deck. As you do, you use countermagic and bounce spells to keep your opponent at bay.

            <h3>CONTROL</h3>
            <p> 
                This Blue-Green control deck seeks to prevent combat damage with fog effect spells, staying alive for as long as possible without playing a single creature.    
                In combination with a Mill spell in Stream of Thought, this deck can recoup its damage prevention, or life gain spells in Weather The Storm, whilst causing the opponent to run out of cards before managing to kill you. Once the opponent has run out of cards, you win - what fun!
