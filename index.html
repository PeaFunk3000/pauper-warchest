            <h2>Boros Bully</h2>
            <h3>AGGRO</h3>
            <p> 
                Boros Bully has one real path to victory and that is heading into the Red Zone.
                It wants to use its air force, composed of Squadron Hawk and Battle Screech, backed up with a board-wide power buff in Rally the Peasants to win over one or two attacks. 
                Recursive spells Strands, Screech, and Faithless Looting as well as recursive creatures in Sacred Cat and Lunarch Veteran, plus lifegain, give the deck some grinding power too!

            <h3>AGGRO</h3>
            <img src="./assets/imgs/aggro.png">
            <p>
                Aggro (short for aggressive) decks attempt to reduce their opponents from 20 life to 0 life as quickly as possible, rather than emphasize a long-term game plan. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Aggro decks focus on converting their cards into damage; they prefer to engage in a race for tempo rather than a card advantage-based war of attrition.
            </p>

        <div class="archetype-body">
            <h3>CONTROL</h3>
            <img src="./assets/imgs/control.png">
            <p>
                Control decks represent the polar opposite of aggro decks, geared for the long game.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Control decks focus on shutting down the opponent, and win the game later, at their own convenience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their top priority is to stop the opponent from executing his or her game plan and appeals to players who enjoy playing long, and oftentimes complex, games.

            <h3>COMBO</h3>
            <img src="./assets/imgs/combo.png">
            <p>
                The combo archetype (short for combination) focuses on playing two or more cards, often with precise timing, to give you a greater advantage over the effects of individual cards.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Combo decks aim to win the game using a relatively small number of synergistic cards that instantly or very quickly win the game when combined.

            <h2>Dimir Delver</h2>
            <h3>CONTROL</h3>
            <p> 
                Dimir Delver is a control shell, which plays just 8 main threats in a full playset of both Gurmag Angler and Tolarian Terror (big 5/5 creatures that can use the graveyard to reduce their casting cost from 7 to as low as 1!).
                Backed up with the classic Delver of Secrets, the rest of the deck is classic draw, kill and counter spells, as well as some self-mill cantrips in Thought Scour to feed the big threats! 
            </p>
